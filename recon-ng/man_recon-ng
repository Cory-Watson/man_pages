NAME
       recon-ng - Web Reconnaissance framework

SYNOPSIS
       recon-ng  recon-ng [-h] [-v] [-w workspace] [-r filename] [--no-check] [--no-ana‐
       lytics]

DESCRIPTION
       Recon-ng is a full-featured Web Reconnaissance framework written in Python.  Com‐
       plete  with independent modules, database interaction, built in convenience func‐
       tions, interactive help, and command completion,  Recon-ng  provides  a  powerful
       environment  in  which  open  source  web-based  reconnaissance  can be conducted
       quickly and thoroughly.

       Recon-ng has a look and feel similar to the Metasploit  Framework,  reducing  the
       learning  curve  for  leveraging  the  framework. However, it is quite different.
       Recon-ng is not intended to compete with existing frameworks, as it  is  designed
       exclusively for web-based open source reconnaissance. If you want to exploit, use
       the Metasploit Framework. If you want to social engineer, use the Social-Engineer
       Toolkit.

       See        the       [Usage       Guide](https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-
       ng/wiki/Usage%20Guide) for more information.
