NAME
       npm - javascript package manager

SYNOPSIS
         npm <command> [args]

VERSION
       6.2.0

DESCRIPTION
       npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.  It puts mod‐
       ules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts
       intelligently.

       It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases.  Most
       commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node  pro‐
       grams.

       Run npm help to get a list of available commands.

INTRODUCTION
       You probably got npm because you want to install stuff.

       Use npm install blerg to install the latest version of "blerg".  Check out
       npm help npm-install for more info.  It can do a lot of stuff.

       Use the npm search command to show everything that's available.   Use  npm
       ls to show everything you've installed.

DEPENDENCIES
       If  a package references to another package with a git URL, npm depends on
       a preinstalled git.

       If one of the packages npm tries to install is a native  node  module  and
       requires    compiling    of    C++    Code,    npm   will   use   node-gyp
       https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp for that task.  For a Unix system,
       node-gyp  https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp needs Python, make and a
       buildchain like GCC. On Windows, Python and Microsoft  Visual  Studio  C++
       are     needed.    Python    3    is    not    supported    by    node-gyp
       https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp.  For more information  visit  the
       node-gyp   repository   https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp   and  the
       node-gyp Wiki https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp/wiki.

DIRECTORIES
       See npm help 5 npm-folders to learn about where npm puts stuff.

       In particular, npm has two modes of operation:

       · global mode: npm installs packages  into  the  install  prefix  at  pre‐
         fix/lib/node_modules and bins are installed in prefix/bin.

       · local  mode:  npm  installs packages into the current project directory,
         which defaults to the current working directory.  Packages are installed
         to ./node_modules, and bins are installed to ./node_modules/.bin.

       Local  mode  is the default.  Use -g or --global on any command to operate
       in global mode instead.

DEVELOPER USAGE
       If you're using npm to develop and publish your code, check out  the  fol‐
       lowing help topics:

       · json: Make a package.json file.  See npm help 5 package.json.

       · link:  For  linking  your current working code into Node's path, so that
         you don't have to reinstall every time you make a change.  Use npm  link
         to do this.

       · install:  It's  a good idea to install things if you don't need the sym‐
         bolic link.  Especially, installing other peoples code from the registry
         is done via npm install

       · adduser:  Create  an  account  or log in.  Credentials are stored in the
         user config file.

       · publish: Use the npm publish command to upload your  code  to  the  reg‐
         istry.

CONFIGURATION
       npm  is extremely configurable.  It reads its configuration options from 5
       places.

       · Command line switches: Set a config with --key val.   All  keys  take  a
         value,  even  if  they are booleans (the config parser doesn't know what
         the options are at the time of parsing).  If no value is provided,  then
         the option is set to boolean true.

       · Environment  Variables: Set any config by prefixing the name in an envi‐
         ronment  variable  with  npm_config_.   For  example,  export   npm_con‐
         fig_key=val.

       · User  Configs: The file at $HOME/.npmrc is an ini-formatted list of con‐
         figs.  If present, it is parsed.  If the userconfig option is set in the
         cli or env, then that will be used instead.

       · Global  Configs:  The  file  found  at  ../etc/npmrc (from the node exe‐
         cutable, by default  this  resolves  to  /usr/local/etc/npmrc)  will  be
         parsed  if  it  is found.  If the globalconfig option is set in the cli,
         env, or user config, then that file is parsed instead.

       · Defaults:  npm's  default   configuration   options   are   defined   in
         lib/utils/config-defs.js.  These must not be changed.

       See npm help 7 npm-config for much much more information.
