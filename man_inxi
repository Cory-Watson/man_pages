NAME
       inxi  - Command line system information script for console and IRC

SYNOPSIS
       inxi  - Single line, short form. Very basic output.

       inxi [-AbCdDfFGhHiIlmMnNopPrRsSuw] [-c NUMBER] [-v NUMBER]

       inxi [-t (c or m or cm or mc NUMBER)] [-x -OPTION(s)] [-xx -OPTION(s)] [-xxx -OPTION(s)]

       inxi [--help] [--recommends] [--version] [-@ NUMBER]

DESCRIPTION
       inxi  is  a command line system information script built for for console and IRC. It is also used for forum technical support, as a debugging tool, to quickly
       ascertain user system configuration and hardware. inxi shows system hardware, CPU, drivers, Xorg, Desktop, Kernel, GCC version(s), Processes, RAM usage, and a
       wide variety of other useful information.  inxi output varies between CLI and IRC, with some default filters and color options applied to IRC use. Script col‐
       ors can be turned off if desired with -c 0, or changed using the -c color options listed in the OPTIONS section below.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY
       In order to maintain basic privacy and security, inxi filters out automatically on IRC things like your network card mac address, WAN and LAN IP,  your  /home
       username directory in partitions, and a few other things.

       Because  inxi  is often used on forums for support, you can also trigger this filtering with the -z option (-Fz, for example). To override the IRC filter, you
       can use the -Z option. This can be useful to debug network connection issues online in a private chat, for example.

USING OPTIONS
       Options can be combined if they do not conflict. Either group the letters together or separate them.

       Letters with numbers can have no gap or a gap at your discretion unless using  -t.

       For example:

       inxi -AG or inxi -A -G or inxi -c10

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -A     Show Audio/sound card information.

       -b     Shows basic output, short form (previously -d). Same as: inxi -v 2

       -c [0-32]
              Available color schemes. Scheme number is required.

              Supported color schemes: 0-32

       -c [94-99]
              Color selectors run a color selector option  prior to inxi starting which lets you set the config file value for the selection.

              Color selectors for each type display (NOTE: irc and global only show safe color set):

       -c 94  - Console, out of X.

       -c 95  - Terminal, running in X - like xTerm.

       -c 96  - Gui IRC, running in X - like Xchat, Quassel, Konversation etc.

       -c 97  - Console IRC running in X - like irssi in xTerm.

       -c 98  - Console IRC not in  X.

       -c 99  - Global - Overrides/removes all settings.

              Setting specific color type removes the global color selection.

       -C     Show full CPU output, including per CPU clockspeed and CPU max speed (if available). If max speed data present, shows (max)  in  short  output  formats
              (inxi,  inxi  -b) if CPU actual speed matches CPU max speed. If CPU max speed does not match CPU actual speed, shows both actual and max speed informa‐
              tion. See -x and -xx for more options.

       -d     Shows optical drive data. Same as -Dd. With -x, adds features line to output.  -xx adds a few more features.

       -D     Show full hard Disk info, not only model, ie: /dev/sda ST380817AS 80.0GB. Shows disk space total + used percentage.  The disk used percentage  includes
              space  used  by swap partition(s), since those are not usable for data storage. Note that with RAID disks, the percentage will be wrong since the total
              is computed from the disk sizes, but the used is computed from mounted partition used percentages. This small defect may get corrected in  the  future.
              Also, unmounted partitions are not counted in disk use percentages since inxi has no access to that data.

       -f     Show all cpu flags used, not just the short list. Not shown with -F to avoid spamming. ARM cpus: show features items.

       -F     Show  Full  output for inxi. Includes all Upper Case line letters, plus -s and -n.  Does not show extra verbose options like -d -f -l -m -o -p -r -t -u
              -x unless you use those arguments in the command, like: inxi -Frmxx

       -G     Show Graphic card information. Card(s), Display Server (vendor and version number), for example: Display Server: Xorg 1.15.1 ,screen resolution(s), glx
              renderer, version). At some point Wayland and other display servers may be added once enough data has been collected.

       -h     The help menu. Features dynamic sizing to fit into terminal window. Set script global COLS_MAX_CONSOLE if you want a different default value, or use -y
              <width> to temporarily override the defaults or actual window width.

       --help Same as -h

       -H     The help menu, plus developer options. Do not use dev options in normal operation!

       -i     Show Wan IP address, and shows local interfaces (requires ifconfig network tool).  Same as -Nni. Not shown with  -F  for  user  security  reasons,  you
              shouldn't paste your local/wan IP.

       -I     Show  Information:  processes, uptime, memory, irc client (or shell type if run in shell, not irc), inxi version.  See -x and -xx for extra information
              (init type/version, runlevel).

       -l     Show partition labels. Default: short partition -P. For full -p output, use: -pl (or -plu).

       -m     Memory (RAM) data. Does not show with  -b or  -F unless you use  -m explicitly. Ordered by system board physical system memory array(s) (Array-[number]
              capacity:),  and  individual memory devices (Device-[number]). Physical memory array(s) data shows array capacity, and number of devices supported, and
              Error Correction information. Devices shows locator data (highly variable in syntax), size, speed, type (eg: type: DDR3).

              Note that -m uses dmidecode, which must be run as root (or start inxi with sudo), unless you figure out how to set up sudo to permit dmidecode to  read
              /dev/mem as user. Note that speed will not show if No Module Installed is found in size. This will also turn off Bus Width data output if it is null.

              Because  dmidecode  data is extremely unreliable, inxi will try to make best guesses. If you see (check) after capacity number, you should check it for
              sure with specifications. (est) is slightly more reliable, but you should still check the real specifications before buying ram. Unfortunately there is
              nothing inxi can do to get truly reliable data about the system ram, maybe one day the kernel devs will put this data into /sys, and make it real data,
              taken from the actual system, not dmi data. For most people, the data will be right, but a significant percentage of users will have  either  wron  max
              module size, if present, or max capacity.

       -M     Show  machine  data.  Motherboard,  Bios,  and  if present, System Builder (Like Lenovo).  Older systems/kernels without the required /sys data can use
              dmidecode instead, run as root. If using dmidecode, may also show bios revision as well as version. -! 33 can force use of dmidecode  data  instead  of
              /sys.

       -n     Show Advanced Network card information. Same as -Nn. Shows interface, speed, mac id, state, etc.

       -N     Show Network card information. With -x, shows PCI BusID, Port number.

       -o     Show  unmounted partition information (includes UUID and LABEL if available).  Shows file system type if you have file installed, if you are root OR if
              you have added to /etc/sudoers (sudo v. 1.7 or newer):

              <username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/file (sample)

              Does not show components (partitions that create the md raid array) of md-raid arrays.

       -p     Show full partition information (-P plus all other detected partitions).

       -P     Show Partition information (shows what -v 4 would show, but without extra data).  Shows, if detected: / /boot /home /tmp /usr /var. Use -p to  see  all
              mounted partitions.

       -r     Show distro repository data. Currently supported repo types:

              APT (Debian, Ubuntu + derived versions)

              PACMAN (Arch Linux + derived versions)

              PISI (Pardus + derived versions)

              PORTAGE (Gentoo, Sabayon + derived versions)

              PORTS (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD + derived OS types)

              SLACKPKG (Slackware + derived versions)

              URPMQ (Mandriva, Mageia + derived versions)

              YUM/ZYPP (Fedora, Redhat, maybe Suse + derived versions)

              (as distro data is collected more will be added. If your's is missing please show us how to get this information and we'll try to add it.)

       -R     Show  RAID  data.  Shows  RAID  devices,  states,  levels, and components, and extra data with -x / -xx.  md-raid: If device is resyncing, shows resync
              progress line as well.

       --recommends
              Checks inxi application dependencies + recommends, and directories, then shows what package(s) you need to install to add support for that feature.

       -s     Show sensors output (if sensors installed/configured): mobo/cpu/gpu temp; detected fan speeds. Gpu temp only for  Fglrx/Nvidia  drivers.  Nvidia  shows
              screen number for > 1 screens.

       -S     Show System information: host name, kernel, desktop environment (if in X), distro. With -xx show dm - or startx - (only shows if present and running if
              out of X), and if in X, with -xxx show more desktop info, like shell/panel etc.

       -t [c or m or cm or mc NUMBER]
              Show processes. If followed by numbers 1-20, shows that number of processes for each type (default: 5; if in irc, max: 5)

              Make sure to have no space between letters and numbers (-t cm10 - right, -t cm 10 - wrong).

       -t c   - cpu only. With -x, shows also memory for that process on same line.

       -t m   - memory only. With -x, shows also cpu for that process on same line. If the i-I line is not triggered, will also show the system used/total ram infor‐
              mation in the first Memory line of output.

       -t cm  - cpu+memory. With -x, shows also cpu or memory for that process on same line.

       -u     Show partition UUIDs. Default: short partition -P. For full -p output, use: -pu (or -plu).

       -U     Note - Maintainer may have disabled this function.

              If inxi -h has no listing for -U then its disabled.

              Auto-update  script.  Note:  if  you  installed  as root, you must be root to update, otherwise user is fine. Also installs / updates this Man Page to:
              /usr/share/man/man8 This requires that you be root to write to that directory.

       -V     inxi version information. Prints information then exits.

       --version
              same as -V

       -v     Script verbosity levels. Verbosity level number is required. Should not be used with -b or -F.

              Supported levels: 0-7 Examples : inxi -v 4  or  inxi -v4

       -v 0   - Short output, same as: inxi

       -v 1   - Basic verbose, -S + basic CPU (cores, model, clock speed, and max speed, if available) + -G + basic Disk + -I.

       -v 2   - Adds networking card (-N), Machine (-M) data, and shows basic hard disk data (names only). Same as: inxi -b

       -v 3   - Adds advanced CPU (-C); network (-n) data; triggers -x advanced data option.

       -v 4   - Adds partition size/filled data (-P) for (if present):/ /home /var/ /boot Shows full disk data (-D)

       -v 5   - Adds audio card (-A); memory/ram (-m);sensors (-s), partition label (-l) and UUID (-u), short form of optical drives.

       -v 6   - Adds full partition data (-p), unmounted partition data (-o), optical drive data (-d); triggers -xx extra data option.

       -v 7   - Adds network IP data (-i); triggers -xxx

       -w     Adds weather line. Note, this depends on an unreliable api so it may not always be working in the future.  To get weather for  an  alternate  location,
              use -W <location_string>. See also -x, -xx, -xxx option.  Please note, your distribution's maintainer may chose to disable this feature, so if -w or -W
              don't work, that's why.

       -W <location_string>
              Get weather/time for an alternate location. Accepts postal/zip code, city,state pair, or latitude,longitude.  Note: city/country/state names  must  not
              contain spaces. Replace spaces with '+' sign. No spaces around , (comma).  Use only ascii letters in city/state/country names, sorry.

              Examples: -W 95623 OR -W Boston,MA OR -W45.5234,-122.6762 OR -W new+york,ny OR -W bodo,norway.

       -y <integer >= 80>
              This is an absolute width override which sets the output line width max. Overrides COLS_MAX_IRC / COLS_MAX_CONSOLE globals, or the actual widths of the
              terminal. If used with -h or -c 94-99, put -y option first or the override will be ignored. Cannot be used with --help/--version/--recommends type long
              options. Example: inxi -y 130 -Fxx

       -z     Adds security filters for IP addresses, Mac, location (-w), and user home directory name. Default on for irc clients.

       -Z     Absolute override for output filters. Useful for debugging networking issues in irc for example.

EXTRA DATA OPTIONS
       These  options  are for long form only, and can be triggered by one or more -x, like -xx.  Alternately, the -v options trigger them in the following way: -v 3
       adds -x; -v 6 adds -xx; -v 7 adds -xxx

       These extra data triggers can be useful for getting more in-depth data on various options.  Can be added to any long form option list, like: -bxx or -Sxxx

       There are 3 extra data levels: -x; -xx; and -xxx

       The following shows which lines / items get extra information with each extra data level.

       -x -A  - Adds version/port(s)/driver version (if available) for each Audio device.

       -x -A  - Shows PCI Bus ID/Usb ID number of each Audio device.

       -x -C  - bogomips on CPU (if available); CPU Flags (short list).

       -x -d  - Adds items to features line of optical drive; adds rev version to optical drive.

       -x -D  - Hdd temp with disk data if you have hddtemp installed, if you are root OR if you have added to /etc/sudoers (sudo v. 1.7 or newer):

              <username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/hddtemp (sample)

       -x -G  - Direct rendering status for Graphics (in X).

       -x -G  - (for single gpu, nvidia driver) screen number gpu is running on.

       -x -G  - Shows PCI Bus ID/Usb ID number of each Graphics card.

       -x -i  - Show IPv6 as well for LAN interface (IF) devices.

       -x -I  - Show current init system (and init rc in some cases, like OpenRC). With -xx, shows init/rc version number, if available.  -x -I -  Show  system  GCC,
              default. With -xx, also show other installed GCC versions.

       -x -I  - Show current runlevel (not available with all init systems).

       -x -I  - If in shell (not in IRC client, that is), show shell version number (if available).

       -x -m  -  Shows  memory device Part Number (part:). Useful to order new or replacement memory sticks etc. Usually part numbers are unique, particularly if you
              use the word memory in the search as well. With -xx, shows Serial Number and Manufactorer as well.

       -x -m  - If present, shows maximum memory module/device size in the Array line. Only some systems will have this data available.

       -x -N  - Adds version/port(s)/driver version (if available) for each Network card;

       -x -N  - Shows PCI Bus ID/Usb ID number of each Network card.

       -x -R  - md-raid: Shows component raid id. Adds second RAID Info line: raid level; report on drives (like 5/5);  blocks;  chunk  size;  bitmap  (if  present).
              Resync line, shows blocks synced/total blocks.

              - zfs-raid: Shows raid array full size; available size; portion allocated to RAID (ie, not available as storage)."

       -x -S  - Desktop toolkit if available (GNOME/XFCE/KDE only); Kernel gcc version.

       -x -t  -  Adds  memory  use  output to cpu (-xt c), and cpu use to memory (-xt m). For -xt c will also show system Used/Total ram data if -t m (memory) is not
              used AND -I is not triggered.

       -x -w / -W
              - Adds wind speed and time zone (-w only), and makes output go to two lines.

       -xx -A - Adds vendor:product ID of each Audio device.

       -xx -I - Adds other detected installed gcc versions to primary gcc output (if present).

       -xx -I - Show, if detected, system default runlevel. Supports Systemd/Upstart/Sysvinit type defaults. Note that not all systemd systems have the default value
              set, in that case, if present, it will use the data from /etc/inittab.

       -xx -I - Adds parent program (or tty) that started shell, if not IRC client, to shell information.

       -xx -m - Shows memory device Manufacturer and Serial Number.

       -xx -m -  Single/double  bank  memory,  if data is found. Note, this may not be 100% right all of the time since it depends on the order that data is found in
              dmidecode output for type 6 and type 17.

       -xx -M - Adds chassis information, if any data for that is available. Also shows BIOS rom size if using dmidecode.

       -xx -N - Adds vendor:product ID of each Network card.

       -xx -R - md-raid: Adds superblock (if present); algorythm, U data. Adds system info line (kernel support, read ahead, raid events). Adds  if  present,  unused
              device line.  If device is resyncing, shows resync progress line as well.

       -xx -S - Adds, if run in X, display manager type to Desktop information, if present. If none, shows N/A.  Supports most known display managers, like xdm, gdm,
              kdm, slim, lightdm, or mdm.

       -xx -w / -W
              - Adds humidity and barometric pressure.

       -xxx -m
              - Memory bus width: primary bus width, and if present, total width. eg: bus width: 64 bit (total: 72 bits). Note that total / data widths are mixed  up
              sometimes  in  dmidecode  output, so inxi will take the larger value as total if present. If no total width data is found, then inxi will not show that
              item.

       -xxx -m
              - Adds device Type Detail, eg: DDR3 (Synchronous).

       -xxx -m
              - If present, will add memory module voltage. Only some systems will have this data available.

       -xxx -S
              - Adds, if run in X, shell/panel type info to Desktop information, if present. If none, shows nothing.   Supports  some  current  desktop  extras  like
              gnome-panel, lxde-panel, and others. Added mainly for Mint support.

       -xxx -w / -W
              -  Adds location (city state country), weather observation time, altitude of system.  If wind chill, heat index, or dew point are available, shows that
              data as well.

ADVANCED OPTIONS
       -! 31  Turns off hostname in System line. Useful, with -z, for anonymizing your inxi output for posting on forums or IRC.

       -! 32  Turns on hostname in System line. Overrides inxi config file value (if set): B_SHOW_HOST='false'.

       -! 33  Force use of dmidecode. This will override /sys data in some lines, like -M.

DEBUGGING OPTIONS
       -%     Overrides defective or corrupted data.

       -@     Triggers debugger output. Requires debugging level 1-14 (8-10 - logging of data).  Less than 8 just triggers inxi debugger output on screen.

       -@ [1-7]
              - On screen debugger output.

       -@ 8   - Basic logging. Check /home/yourname/.inxi/inxi*.log

       -@ 9   - Full file/sys info logging.

       -@ 10  - Color logging.

       -@ <11-14>
              The following create a tar.gz file of system data, plus collecting the inxi output to file: To  automatically  upload  debugger  data  tar.gz  file  to
              ftp.techpatterns.com:

              inxi -xx@ <11-14>

              For alternate ftp upload locations: Example:

              inxi -! ftp.yourserver.com/incoming -xx@ 14

       -@ 11  - With data file of xiin read of /sys

       -@ 12  - With xorg conf and log data, xrandr, xprop, xdpyinfo, glxinfo etc.

       -@ 13  - With data from dev, disks, partitions, etc., plus xiin data file.

       -@ 14  - Everything, full data collection.

SUPPORTED IRC CLIENTS
       BitchX,  Gaim/Pidgin,  ircII, Irssi, Konversation, Kopete, KSirc, KVIrc, Weechat, and Xchat. Plus any others that are capable of displaying either built in or
       external script output.

RUNNING IN IRC CLIENT
       To trigger inxi output in your IRC client, pick the appropriate method from the list below:

       Xchat, irssi (and many other IRC clients)
              /exec -o inxi [options] If you leave off the -o, only you will see the output on your local IRC client.

       Konversation
              /cmd inxi [options] To run inxi in konversation as a native script if your distribution or inxi package did not do this for you, create  this  symbolic
              link:

              ln -s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/kde4/apps/konversation/scripts/inxi

              If inxi is somewhere else, change the path /usr/local/bin to wherever it is located.

              Then you can start inxi directly, like this:

              /inxi [options]

       WeeChat
              NEW: /exec -o inxi [options]

              OLD: /shell -o inxi [options]

              Newer  (2014  and  later)  WeeChats work pretty much the same now as other console IRC clients, with /exec -o inxi [options]. Also, newer WeeChats have
              dropped the -curses part of their program name, ie: weechat instead of weechat-curses.

              Deprecated:

              Before WeeChat can run external scripts like inxi, you need to install the weechat-plugins package. This is automatically installed for  Debian  users.
              Next, if you don't already have it, you need to install shell.py, which is a python script.

              In a web browser, Click on the download button at: https://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/stable/shell.py.html/

              Make the script executable by

              chmod +x shell.py

              Move it to your home folder: /.weechat/python/autoload/ then logout, and start WeeChat with

              weechat-curses

              Top of screen should say what pythons scripts have loaded, and should include shell. Then to run inxi, you would enter a command like this:

              /shell -o inxi -bx

              If you leave off the -o, only you will see the output on your local weechat. WeeChat users may also like to check out the weeget.py

INITIALIZATION FILE
       inxi will read the following configuration/initialization files in the following order:

       /etc/inxi.conf

       $HOME/.inxi/inxi.conf

       See wiki pages for more information on how to set these up:

BUGS
       Please report bugs using the following resources.

       You  may  be asked to run the inxi debugger tool which will upload a data dump of all system files for use in debugging inxi. These data dumps are very impor‐
       tant since they provide us with all the real system data inxi uses to parse out its report.

       inxi main website/svn/wiki, file an issue report:

AUTHOR AND CONTRIBUTORS TO CODE
       inxi is is a fork of locsmif's largely unmaintained yet very clever, infobash script.

       Original infobash author and copyright holder: Copyright (C) 2005-2007  Michiel de Boer a.k.a. locsmif

       inxi version: Copyright (C) 2008-15 Scott Rogers & Harald Hope

       Further fixes (listed as known): Horst Tritremmel <hjt at sidux.com>

       Steven Barrett (aka: damentz) - usb audio patch; swap percent used patch.  Jarett.Stevens - dmidecode -M patch for older systems with no /sys

       And a special thanks to the nice people at irc.oftc.net channels #linux-smokers-club and #smxi, who  all really have to  be  considered  to  be  co-developers
       because of their non-stop enthusiasm and willingness to provide real time testing and debugging of inxi development.

       Without  a wide range of diverse Linux kernel based Free Desktop systems to test on, we could never have gotten inxi to be as reliable and solid as it's turn‐
       ing out to be.

       And of course, big thanks locsmif, who figured out a lot of the core methods, logic, and tricks used in inxi.

       Further thanks to the various inxi package maintainers, distro support people, forum moderators, and others, who contribute ideas, suggestions, and patches.
